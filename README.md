# Sleep

A collection of REST clients in Haskell.

The goal is to provide simple, easy to use, and independent clients for a
variety of sites that provide a REST API, starting with Tumblr. A previous
attempt at this was [RCL](github.com/nicuveo/RCL), for
[Remember The Milk](rememberthemil.com).

This is, at this stage, nothing but a work in progress.
